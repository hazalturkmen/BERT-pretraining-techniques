# A Pipeline Of Simultaneous pretraining with amplified vocabulary Bert On Google TPU
A pipeline of pertaining Bert on biomedical dataset using google TPU to implement Simultaneous pre-training with amplified vocabulary approach [1] 


# Introduction
Pretrained language models elevated with in-domain corpora show impressive results in biomedicine and clinical NLP tasks in English. However, there is minimal work in low resource languages.This repo introduces Simultaneous pre-training with amplified vocabulary approach [1] to enhance BERT models which are developed from low resource languages. Unlike implementation of proposed work [1], engineering proceses redesigned for TPU devices.
