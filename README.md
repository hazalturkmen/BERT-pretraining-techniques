# A Pipeline Of Bert pretraining  techniques On Google TPU
A pipeline of  various pertaining Bert approaches on text dataset using google TPU. 


# Introduction
This repo introduces various pre-training  approaches  to enhance generic BERT models. All engineering proceses designed for TPU devices. Pre-training methods implemented using [NPL library](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp) from [TF2 model garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).

 1. Pre-training from scratch
 2. Contiunal pre-training
 3. Simultaneous pre-training
